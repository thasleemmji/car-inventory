## About Mini Car Inventory Laravel Application

This is a web application using which a user can create a manufacturer and thus create new Models of Cars with different colors, registration numbers, add images, etc. Also the inventory listing section has all the inventory data and user can change the "Sold" status of any particular car.

## Something about Laravel

Laravel is fun and as they say "Programming is an Art form", one will love it once implemented.
Rasmus Lerdorf, creator of PHP, said once,: "Frameworks sucks". Yes this one definitely. But you will enjoy it.
